This is the open source Arecibo client that allows you to record errors on your website, formed off of: http://areciboapp.com

This is an App Engine project that you can upload to App Engine and run this application, then point all your sites to use that system.

Creating an App Engine instance
-----------------------

- create an App Engine instance at https://appengine.google.com/ (this is free)

- the name of your instance is used in the next step, examples could be my-company-arecibo which would give you an App Engine instance at http://my-company-arecibo.appspot.com

Download the App Engine API
-----------------------

- if you don't already have it, you need to download the App Engine API: http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

Creating your App Engine site
-----------------------

- grab a copy of this site, from github http://github.com/andymckay/arecibo/, eg: git clone git://github.com/andymckay/arecibo.git

- in the listener/app_engine directory:

    - copy local_settings.py.example to local_settings.py. Set whatever key you would like for ARECIBO_PUBLIC_ACCOUNT_NUMBER or ARECIBO_PRIVATE_ACCOUNT_NUMBER. The ARECIBO_PUBLIC_ACCOUNT_NUMBER is what you send from your websites

    - copy app.yaml.example to app.yaml and set the application: to match the name of the application you've created on App Engine

Deploy your app
-----------------------

- in the listener/app_engine directory:
    
    - appcfg.py update .

Congrats, your Arecibo app has now been deployed.

Logging in users
-----------------------

- any user with a Google account can login to your Arecibo account, however they cannot view anything  at all until you give them access.

- as the admin go to your App Engine admin console http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/theadminconsole.html, go to your app > datastore viewer > select user from the drop down > find user > and set "is_staff" to True

- if you got Google Apps already for your domain, then you can restrict the login just to your domain in App Engine 

Send errors to your app
-----------------------

To send errors to the app, you just to send HTTP posts to http://my-company-arecibo.appspot.com/v/1/

The API key must match what you set in local_settings, otherwise Arecibo will just reject the post.
