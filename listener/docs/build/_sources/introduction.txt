Introduction to Arecibo
==============================

Arecibo is an error tracker. It allows you to log errors from web sites and collect them all in one location. It then allows you to prioritise and group them. Notifications can then be sent to developers of the errors.

There are two main components to Arecibo:

* client, this is normally a web application on residing on a server that sends an error into Arecibo. If there isn't an existing API for your application, then there's an API you can use to build your own.

* server, this is your instance of Arecibo that you can use to receive errors.
